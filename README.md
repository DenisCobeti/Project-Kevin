# PROJECT KEVIN

A game engine completely done in Java! 

This project is meant only for educational purposes, as it has a lot of optimization problems that 
prevent it from being used in a serious game development environment. It has been developed 
more as an experiment than a serious tool.

This project started as general software design documentation that evolved into an actual program, 
that´s why the prototypes and all the documents are included. These documents are written in Spanish, 
however the code is exclusively in English.

## Komet Kevin

Komet Kevin is a videogame done within this engine. It is 2d with vector-based physics.
Its main objective is to survive the longest amount of time possible while the player is being overwhelmed 
by asteroids. 

We will use the game engine disigned specifically for this application, however the separation between the 
engine and the game will be guaranteed.
